# Announcing Linkwarden 2.13

Today, we're excited to announce the release of **[Linkwarden 2.13](https://linkwarden.app/?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=v2_13_announcement)**! 🥳 This update brings significant improvements and new features to enhance your experience.

For those who are new to Linkwarden, it’s basically a tool to collect, read, annotate, and fully preserve webpages, articles, and documents, all in one place. It’s great for bookmarking stuff to read later, and you can also share your resources, create public collections, and collaborate with your team. Linkwarden is available as a **[Cloud](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing)** subscription or you can **[self-host](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/installation)** it on your own server.

This release brings a range of updates to make your bookmarking and archiving experience even smoother. Let’s take a look:

## What’s new:

### 🏷️ New Tag Management Page

We added a dedicated page where you can view, sort, add, bulk merge, and bulk delete you Tags, all in one place.

<video controls width="100%">
  <source src={useBaseUrl("/assets/v2.13/tags.mp4")} />
</video>

### ⚙️ Compact Sidebar

You can now shrink the sidebar for a more compact and minimal look.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="compact" label="Compact" default>
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/assets/v2.13/compact.jpeg")} alt="Details" height="500"/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="normal" label="Normal">
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/assets/v2.13/normal.jpeg")} alt="Edit" height="500" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 🐞 Bug fixes and Optimizations

This release comes with many bug fixes, security fixes, and optimizations that's recommended for all users.

### ✅ And more...

## Want to skip the technical setup?

If you’d rather skip server setup and maintenance, our **[Cloud Plan](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing)** takes care of everything for you. It’s a great way to access all of Linkwarden’s features—plus future updates—without the technical overhead.
