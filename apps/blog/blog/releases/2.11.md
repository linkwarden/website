# Announcing Linkwarden 2.11

Today, we're excited to announce the release of **[Linkwarden 2.11](https://linkwarden.app/?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=v2_11_announcement)**! 🥳 This update brings significant improvements and new features to enhance your experience.

For those who are new to Linkwarden, it’s basically a tool for saving and organizing webpages, articles, and documents all in one place. It’s great for bookmarking stuff to read later, and you can also share your resources, create public collections, and collaborate with your team. Linkwarden is available as a **[Cloud](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing)** subscription or you can **[self-host](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/installation)** it on your own server.

This release brings a range of updates to make your bookmarking and archiving experience even smoother. Let’s take a look:

## What’s new:

### ✨ Customizable Readable View

You can now configure the font style, font size, line height, and line width for the readable view. This allows you to create a more personalized reading experience that suits your preferences.

This feature essentially gives Linkwarden what other read-it-later apps like [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) offered.

### 📝 Add Notes to Highlights

You can now add notes to your highlights in the readable view and view them in the highlights sidebar. This is a great way to jot down your thoughts or insights while reading, making it easier to remember key points later.

### ⚙️ Customizable Dashboard

The dashboard has received a major overhaul! You can now customize it to show the information that matters most to you. Choose from various widgets like recent links, pinned links, or your saved collections. This makes it easier to access the content you care about right from the dashboard.

### 📥 Import from Pocket

Good news for Pocket users! You can now import your saved links from Pocket into Linkwarden. This makes it easy to transition to Linkwarden without losing your existing bookmarks.
