## What's New?

:::tip

### 🛠️ Code Refactoring and Optimization

The first thing you'll notice here is that Linkwarden is now faster and more efficient.[^1] And also the data now loads a skeleton placeholder while fetching the data instead of saying "you have no links", making the app feel more responsive.

Here's a before and after comparison of the loading state:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="before" label="Before (v2.6.2)" default>
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/assets/v2.7/loading_before.jpeg")} alt="Before"/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="after" label="After (v2.7.0)">
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/assets/v2.7/loading_after.jpeg")} alt="After" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 🌐 Added More Translations

Thanks to the collaborators, we've added Chinese and French translations to Linkwarden. If you'd like to help us translate Linkwarden into your language, check out [#216](https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden/issues/216).

[^1]: _This took a lot more work than it should have since we had to refactor the whole server-side state management to use react-query instead of Zustand._
