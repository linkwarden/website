# Announcing Linkwarden for iOS & Android

![Announcement Banner](/assets/mobile_announement/banner.jpeg)

<!--truncate-->

Hello everyone,

Before we talk about today’s announcement, let's take a moment to appreciate what this community has built together. What started as a project to preserve webpages and articles has quietly grown into [Linkwarden](https://linkwarden.app), a tool used by researchers, journalists, and knowledge collectors all over the world.

As we’ve grown, the Linkwarden community has helped us reach:

- 16,000+ GitHub stars
- 11M+ Docker downloads
- Thousands of self-hosted instances running in different companies, universities, agencies, and homelabs
- A thriving ecosystem of contributors, donors, and Cloud subscribers keeping the project sustainable

None of this would've happened without you. Thank you! 🚀

Today, we’re excited to launch something you’ve been asking for since the very beginning: **the official Linkwarden mobile app**, now available on **[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/linkwarden/id6752550960)** and **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.linkwarden)**.

</p>

Here are the highlights so far:

- 🧩 **Create, organize, and browse your links:** A native, mobile-first experience with collections, tags, and powerful search.

- 📤 **Save links directly from the share sheet:** Send interesting articles from the browser or any other app straight into Linkwarden, no copy-paste required.

- 📚 **Cached data for offline reading:** Catch up on long reads, articles, or saved blog posts when you’re away from Wi-Fi.

- ☁️ **Works with Linkwarden Cloud and self-hosted:** Use the same app whether you’re on Linkwarden Cloud or your own self-hosted instance, just point it at your server and sign in.

- 📱 **Built for different screen sizes:** Supports iOS / iPadOS, and Android (phones and tablets).

- 🔜 **And more coming soon:** This first release is just the foundation, expect many improvements and new features soon.

## Get the app

**To use the app you’ll first need a Linkwarden account (version v2.13+ recommended).**

You can choose between:

- [**Linkwarden Cloud**](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing) – instant setup, and your subscription directly supports ongoing development.
- [**Self-hosted Linkwarden**](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/installation) – free, but you’ll need to deploy and maintain a Linkwarden instance on a server.

After creating an account, download the app from your preferred store:

[![Download on the App Store](/assets/mobile_announement/app_store.png)](https://apps.apple.com/app/linkwarden/id6752550960)
[![Get it on Google Play](/assets/mobile_announement/google_play.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.linkwarden)
