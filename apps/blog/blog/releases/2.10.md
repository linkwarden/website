# Announcing Linkwarden 2.10

Today, we're excited to announce the release of **[Linkwarden 2.10](https://linkwarden.app/?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=v2_10_announcement)**! 🥳 This update brings significant improvements and new features to enhance your experience.

For those who are new to Linkwarden, it's basically a tool for preserving and organizing webpages, articles, and documents in one place. You can also share your resources with others, create public collections, and collaborate with your team. Linkwarden is available as a **[Cloud](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing)** subscription or you can **[self-host](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/installation)** it on your own server.

This release brings a range of updates to make your bookmarking and archiving experience even smoother. Let’s take a look:

## What’s new:

### ⚡️ Text Highlighting

You can now highlight text in your saved articles while in the readable view! Whether you’re studying, researching, or just storing interesting articles, you’ll be able to quickly locate the key ideas and insights you saved.

</p>

### 🔍 Search Is Now _Much_ More Capable

Our search engine got a big boost! Not only is it faster, but you can now use advanced search operators like `name:`, `url:`, `tag:`, `before:`, `after:` to really narrow down your results. To see all the available operators, check out the [advanced search](https://docs.linkwarden.app/usage/advanced-search) page in the documentation.

For example, to find links tagged “ai tools” before 2020 that aren’t in the “unorganized” collection, you can use the following search query:

```
tag:"ai tools" before:2020-01-01 !collection:unorganized
```

This feature makes it easier than ever to locate the links you need, especially if you have a large number of saved links.

### 🏷️ Tag-Based Preservation

You can now decide how different tags affect the preservation of links. For example, you can set up a tag to automatically preserve links when they are saved, or you can choose to skip preservation for certain tags. This gives you more control over how your links are archived and preserved.

### 👾 Use External Providers for AI Tagging

Previously, Linkwarden offered automated tagging through a local LLM (via Ollama). Now, you can also choose OpenAI, Anthropic, or other external AI providers. This is especially useful if you’re running Linkwarden on lower-end servers to offload the AI tasks to a remote service.

### 🚀 Enhanced AI Tagging

We’ve improved the AI tagging feature to make it even more effective. You can now tag existing links using AI, not just new ones. On top of that, you can also auto-categorize links to existing tags based on the content of each link.

### ⚙️ Worker Management (Admin Only)

For admins, Linkwarden 2.10 makes it easier to manage the archiving process. Clear old preservations or re-archive any failed ones whenever you need to, helping you keep your setup tidy and up to date.

## Want to skip the technical setup?

If you’d rather skip server setup and maintenance, our **[Cloud Plan](https://linkwarden.app/#pricing)** takes care of everything for you. It’s a great way to access all of Linkwarden’s features—plus future updates—without the technical overhead.
