## What’s new:

### ✨ Local AI Tagging (Optional)

We've added a new feature that automatically tags your links based on their content. This feature uses a local AI model to analyze the content of your links and can assign tags to links in 2 ways:

1. **Auto-generate Tags**: When a link is added, Linkwarden will automatically generate and assign tags based on the content of the link.
2. **Using Predefined Tags**: You can also use predefined tags to let Linkwarden auto-assign tags based on the content of the link.

You can enable this feature in the Settings > Preferences page. If you're self-hosting Linkwarden, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.linkwarden.app/self-hosting/ai-worker) for more information on how to set up and use this feature.

### 📸 Capture articles directly from browser extension

Sometimes certain websites prevent bots from accessing their content. In such cases, you can now capture the article directly from your browser using the Linkwarden browser extension and upload it to Linkwarden. Get it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/linkwarden/pnidmkljnhbjfffciajlcpeldoljnidn) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/linkwarden).

_Also please give us a 5-star rating if you like it :D_
